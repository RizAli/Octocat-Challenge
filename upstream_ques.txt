Explain what the 'upstream' remote is usually used for, in your own words

for the octate challenge we first create a repository on the github website. we then cloned it and created a branch "answers"

The master branch is already uploaded on the github website whereas the answers branch is not. This where upstream comes in.

When I tried to use "git push", it popped up an error
fatal: The current branch answers has no upstream branch. 

I then had to use "git push answers" to upstream the branch on the github website.
